                CoolBreeze Experts was founded in 2005 as a small, family-owned business specializing in air conditioning repair services. Over the years, our passion for providing high-quality cooling solutions led to the expansion of our offerings, making us one of the most trusted names in the industry.

                <p class="mt-6 text-lg text-gray-600 max-w-4xl mx-auto">
                    In the early days, we focused exclusively on repairs, helping local families restore comfort to their homes. By 2010, we introduced our installation service, driven by the demand for efficient and energy-saving cooling systems. Our expert team tailored each installation to match the unique needs of our clients.

                    Maintenance services were added in 2015, enabling customers to extend the lifespan of their air conditioning units and reduce energy costs. From small homes to large commercial spaces, CoolBreeze Experts has consistently delivered reliable and professional services designed to keep our customers cool and worry-free.
